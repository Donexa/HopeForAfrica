                        2015 include the goal to eradicate poverty by 2030 and the commitment to "Leave no one
                        behind », a world in which all can live in dignity, regardless of the social situation and
                        economic
                        environment. A world where people claim and assume their rights in a viable civil society.

                        created and compounded by unequal balances of power, are the main drivers of poverty

                        Hope for Africa was founded in 2017 under the initiative of Mr. Eliphaz Bashilwango
                        Lukendobonga,
                        with the aim of breaking the cycle of poverty and helping people to lead a dignified existence,
                        following a civil war
                        which continues to devastating the country for more than two decades now. During
                        this war, our country suffered a serious political crisis from which resulted a socio-economic
                        and
                        security destabilization with fierce and unfortunate consequences: war crimes, enlistment of
                        children in armed forces and groups, massive rape of women causing the advent of the scourge of
                        HIV-AIDS, plundering of natural resources, murders, massive displacement of the population,
                        serious
                        violation of human rights, gender-based sexual violence,... In short, human dignity fiercely
                        flouted.
                        All
                        this; leaving the humanitarian situation to become dramatic and catastrophic. The human rights
                        situation
                        is dire for
                        children and they face a myriad of daily challenges: poverty, sexual violence, disease,
                        and the inability to access food and clean water. Their fundamental rights are regularly
                        violated
                        and
                        they are frequently exposed to violence from armed groups, in some cases abducted and coerced
                        into military forces. The war took hold there, hence the large number of orphans of two parents,
                        not
                        to mention AIDS, which was added to the causes of mortality.
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        During the war, the soldiers and the rebels have and continue to rape and sequester with total
                        impunity young child-girls who have not even reached the age of 15 for the most part. Children
                        were
                        born from these horrific crimes. These children are not accepted. These girls are rejected and
                        entitled
                        to nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        Old grandparents find themselves with grandchildren whom they cannot take care of, whom they
                        cannot feed… Weakened and worn out, they can only wait for manna from heaven
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        Children are forced to work to feed the younger brothers/sisters and the elderly. Children
                        perform
                        heavy work like adults despite their infantile fragility; they have no other choices or other
                        alternatives
                        for survival.
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        These children should be in school instead of working hard all day and coming home exhausted in
                        the evening with a few miserable foodstuffs, to resume the same chore the next day.
                        We see these days that many key sectors of life, such as access to basic social services, are
                        already
                        neglected by those responsible for them and people no longer have the right to lead a dignified
                        existence! The heavy
                        price paid in terms of suffering, sacrifice, injustice, humiliation, tears and the list goes
                        on, has become unbearable for the vast majority of the population in Africa. The reputation and
                        credibility of the DRC
                        are severely damaged both inside and outside the borders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        And yet, it is undeniable that our country and the Great Lakes region have an incredible capital
                        wealth in terms of natural and human resources, of which the population should benefit. This
                        unfortunately is far from
                        being the case, the living conditions of the vast majority of our compatriots being
                        anything but in keeping with human dignity
                    </p>
                    <p class="no_vsb">
                        Faced with these findings and the paradox of our country, "which lacks nothing except
                        everything",
                        people from all walks of life joined in the appeal of the founding president, Eliphaz
                        Bashilwango,
                        development technician, that H4A is the result of his vision so that the living social forces
                        form a
                        sanitary cordon
                        capable of guaranteeing a better life and the radiant hope restored thanks to a dignified
                        existence.

                        To remain silent in the face of the bitter experience of human rights and poverty is only

                        It
                        is
                        in this spirit that the founding members had decided to constitute themselves as a non-profit
                        organization governed by
                        law N° 004-2001 of July 20, 2001.

                            The Indigenous Peoples (Pygmies), one of the minorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
                            have long remained on the margins of modern society. Because of this, they do not have the
                            same political and economic influence as other groups, and their way of life, once purely
                            attached to the forest, has undergone changes that are becoming even more fragile, in a
                            context of progressive sedentarization, yet already disabled.
                        </p>
                        <p class="no_vsb">
                            As a result, their integration is of growing concern to the Government, civil society and
                            even
                            donors in
                            the DRC.
                        </p>
                        <p class="no_vsb">
                            At the community level, very few villages and camps have development committees or
                            associations.
                            There are sometimes
                            thematic committees that have been formed during a project implemented in the village. The
                            lack
                            of school infrastructure
                            (schools) in disadvantaged areas of
                            Africa is one of the causes that limits access to education for children. The direct
                            consequence
                            for this fundamental right is the low rate of education observed in both territories. PAs
                            are
                            virtually
                            illiterate. In all the pilot camps visited, it is common to find no child enrolled in
                            school.
                            They
                            cannot read, write or count. Even when the school is close to the camp, the PA children do
                            not
                            go there. Sometimes there are a few who are registered or who have dropped out. The reasons
                            mentioned by the parents are related to the lack of financial means for the payment of
                            school
                            fees and supplies, discrimination of Batwa children enrolled in schools by the community,
                            starvation among children who
                            are enrolled in school, and above all the long distance for access to
                            existing schools which does not allow the very young to attend, etc. The very low level of
                            income
                            of the communities in all the villages and camps of the IPs of the disadvantaged areas in
                            Africa
                            is the most determining factor of the evils of which they are victims. Meetings and
                            interviews
                            with
                            the communities show that the lack of financial means is mentioned by the populations as
                            being
                            the cause of the non-enrolment of children in school, the death of several people in the
                            village
                            due to lack of health care costs. health, famine (lack of food, malnutrition and
                            insufficient
                            food
                            rations), malformation of habitats, small areas of fields without diversification of
                            speculation
                            (lack
                            of money for seeds), small size of livestock , the lack of trade stalls and shops, etc. In
                            short, without financial
                            possibilities, communities are reduced to general poverty. This situation is more
                            accentuated among IPs who have a nomadic or semi-sedentary lifestyle. In this way of life it
                            is
                            obvious that it is difficult to understand how nomadic pygmies can undertake sewing? The
                            answer is simple because with the decrease and scarcity of biological and wildlife resources
                            in
                            the forests, the pygmies are currently forced to return to settle in the villages in order
                            to
                            seek to
                            develop other sources of vital resources. Among these sources, sewing and trade constitute
                            an
                            important axis to be developed. If the development of sewing can solve the problems of
                            unemployment, famines, stability
                            and increased income; sell wares responds to the lack of living
                            financial capital, and therefore a wealth that IPs and others can use at any time to meet
                            their
                            needs (in healthcare, payment of school fees, purchase of basic necessities , etc.).

                            At the current stage the IPs are almost illiterate, given the importance that education can

                            Hope Center Orphanage supports many homes across the territory of Fizi where
                            orphaned children reside. We also help the orphans of our orphanage in the village
                            of Swima with essential supplies and items, feeding, education and other program
                            impact.

                            In addition, we provide them with warm clothes, socks, shoes, hats and gloves.
                            However, helping orphaned children in the DRC would not have been possible
                            without your support and donations. Since 2014, Hope Center Orphanage has been
                            on the ground supporting orphans and vulnerable children by defending their rights,
                            speaking up for them as advocates, feeding them, clothing them, protecting them
                            from those who mistreat them, ensuring justice for them, sharing our resources with
                            them and finding families for them. We provide them with proper education so that
                            they stand on their feet. Our main focus on the real ministry is to “defend the cause
                            of the fatherless and plead the case of the widow.” Isaiah 1:17. Our goal is to
                            provide sustainable and intensive support to the most marginalized and vulnerable
                            children.
